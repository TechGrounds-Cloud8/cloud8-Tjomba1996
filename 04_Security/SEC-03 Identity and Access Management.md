# Identity and Access Management
There's a few ways to ensure the safety of one's account details. Lately companies have been forced to add additional layers of security to protect sensitive info.

## Key terminology
- Authentication = The process of verifying who someone is(matching username with password)
- Authorization = The process of verifying what the user has access to(think about permissions)
- MFA = Multifactor authentication

## Exercise
- Learn difference between authentication and authorization
- Learn about the three factors of authentication and how MFA improves security
- Learn about principle of least privilege and how it improves security

### Overcome challenges
- Learned a few key terms for security

### Results
- The differense between **Authentication** and **Authorization**:
    - Authentication is the process of verifying who someone is(matching username with password)
    - Authorization is the process of verifying what the user has access to(think about permissions)

- Three factors of authentication(used to authenticate a user):
    1. **What you know:** Password, security question
    2. **What you possess:** Mobile device or app(think DigiD app), security token
    3. **What you are:** Biometric data like a fingerprint, retinal scan, facial recognition

- MFA is used to add more layers of protection by adding more than 1 factor of authentication, so one would need both a password and a Digital app for example. This increases the protection against cyber attacks by "adding more doors" so to say.

- The **Principle of Least Privilege** dictates that a user should **only** have the privileges that it needs to complete it's task. If a subject does not need an access right, it should not have it. This improves security by limiting the possibilities of what can happen, and not giving access to subjects that are either malevolent or not educated well enough to operate on a certain privilege.
