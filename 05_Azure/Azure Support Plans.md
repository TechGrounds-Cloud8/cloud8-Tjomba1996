## **What are Azure Support Plans?**
Azure provides additional services depending on what Support Plan you choose. Some organisations need some more guidance, to optimise their use of the cloud. Azure provides 4 different tier of support plan:
- **Basic**: Free, provides basic services to monitor expenditures
- **Developer**: Around €27,- a month, provides third party software for support, and extra support on business hours.
- **Standard**: Around €93,- a month, provides 24/7 technical support
Below is a schematic as to what you can expect from each tier of support plan.

While Azure provides a lot of services free of charge, to help optimize your architecture, a key difference here are the times at which the customer service is available to resolve issues. There are some minor differences here and there(see table mentioned above). However, the Professional Direct tier has some very interesting benefits when it comes to support:

- Response time is improved, compared to all the other tiers.
- Architectural and Proactive guidance from a pool of ProDirect delivery managers.
- Azure support tickets can be created/managed programmatically.
- Webinars led by Azure Experts

## **Why should you use ASP?**
The services provided in the Basic tier are services that allow you to monitor your architecture. This are free for you to use, so you should definetely use them. Now the decision of what paid tier you would want to use, depends largely on what size the company is, what background knowledge is present and if you are transitioning to cloud(as oposed to already having an architecture). If you're a big company, that doesn't have a good understanding of what the cloud can do for you, you might want to go for Standard or higher, depending on the budget and the quality of architecture you want to go for(bank needs to have a very robust architecture for security purposes). When you are just starting out as a business, maybe have some understanding of the cloud and you're not transitioning, it might be in your best interest to go for the Basis or Developer tier. Now depending on the given variables, some might consider switchen between tiers, but previously mentioned examples should give some insight as how to choose what tier to go for.
