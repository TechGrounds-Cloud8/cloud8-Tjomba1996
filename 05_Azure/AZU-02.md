# Cost Management + Billing
A big part of Cloud-engineering is cost efficiency. So it is crucial to know what you need and what you don't. To be able to make informed decisions, one needs to be able to see what is used. Luckily, Azure has provided a few tools for this specific purpose.

## Key terminology
- OPEX = Operaing expense; An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations. Operating expenses include rent, equipment, inventory costs, marketing, payroll, insurance, step costs, and funds allocated for research and development.
- CAPEX = Capital expense; Capital expenses are purchases that a business makes as an investment. Capital expenditures include costs related to acquiring or upgrading tangible and intangible assets.
