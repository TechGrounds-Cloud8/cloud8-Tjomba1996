# Git and GitHub

## Key terminology
Repository = a place to storage files

Push / Pull = To push code, is to have the remote access code be updated with the code that one has on their local machine. To pull code, is to get it from the remote access

platform to the local machine.

Merge = to combine.

Fork = Forking is to take the source code from an open source software program and develop an entirely new program.

## Exercise

### Overcome challenges
Getting more comfortable with GitHub, pushing and pulling files from both peers and myself. Lots of subject Jargon that now have meaning in context.
