# IP Adressing

## Key terminology
- IP Address = String of numbers seperated by "."(example: 1.2.3.4). This is used to send data from different devices to one another
- IPV4 = 4th protocol, Widely used protocol for data communication. IP addresses are defined in Binary
- IPV6 = 6th protocol, IP's are defined in Hexadecimal, which gives it more available IP's, is more efficient at packet handling, security and performance. It's not compatible with everything though, as much devices/software runs on IPV4
- Public IP = IP that is accessible directly by the internet, is given by your internet service provider(ISP)
- Private IP = IP that your router assigns to all devices within the local network, so they can communicate to one another
- Static IP Address = Simply an IP Address that doesn't change
- Dynamic IP Address = IP that changes regularly, default IP that are provided by ISP

## Exercise
- Discover what the Public IP is of your PC and phone
- Discover what the Private IP is of PC and phone
- Change Private IP of your phone to that of your PC

### Overcome challenges

### Results
- Public IP Of my Phone and my PC are the same, because that is my address to the wider internet.

- Private IP addresses can be found through your router. Private IP of PC starts with 192.168.---.-- . Phone Private IP also starts with 192.168.---.--, but the last 2 digits are different.

- When I change Private IP of Phone to that of my PC, connection quality goes down, but seems to be functioning, albeit a bit unstable.

- When I change private IP adres to an address that is outside the local network, the internet connection is cut off.
