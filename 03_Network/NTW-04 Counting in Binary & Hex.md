# Counting in binary and Hexadecimal
Most people are used to count/calculate using a Decimal system. While that works in general use, computers can only work in ON or OFF, so a different system was introduced: **Binary**. Instead of using each 10 possible symbols(0 through 9) for each spot, binary uses only 2(1 and 0).

Now when a system needs to store data, is might be more interesting to add symbols, so one spot can represent more data. Introducing the **Hexadecimal** system. This way of calculating has 16 symbols(0-9, then a-f) for each spot.

## Key terminology
- Binary = System with 2 symbols(1 and 0)
- Decimal = System with 10 symbols(0-9)
- Hexadecimal = System with 16 symbols(0-9,a-f)
- Bit = Binary digit, smallest unit of data in a computer, represented by a single value of binary
- Byte = Unit of data that is 8 bits long
