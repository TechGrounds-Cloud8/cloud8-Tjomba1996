# Working with text (CLI)

## Key commandlines
- echo "text" = Display text in terminal
- \> = Use this to redirect output
- <  = Use this to redirect input
- echo "text" >> = Use this to add text to a text file, instead of replacing it
- grep "filter" file = Use this to display lines that contains the given filter


## Exercise
- Use echo command and output a sentence containing "techgrounds" to an existing textfile with atleast 2 lines
- Use command to write contents of text file to terminal, but use a filter so only the lines with "techgrounds" are displayed
- Use same command as previous exercise, but redirect the output to a new "techgrounds.txt" file
