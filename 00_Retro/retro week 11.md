# Azurites Retro of Week 11

## What went well?
- Good communication in sources and job interviews.
- Give eachother space when needed.
- Helping when someone encounters a problem.

## What could have gone better?
- Motivation
- Planning was inaccurate, mainly due to inexperience (sometimes due to job interview).
- Implementing solution oriented mindset. A lot of new concepts like bicep, jira and the project documentation. All in all a bit overwhelming at times.

## What can we do to improve?
- Take time to recuperate(be it work hours or free hours) so one has more energy during work hours.
- Gain more experience by trying to plan.
- Cut up problems into smaller problems. Take on 1 thing at a time and finish it.
