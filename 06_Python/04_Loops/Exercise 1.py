## Use a while loop to have a value increase to 10 and print every integer.

x = 0                   ## Declaring value x.

while x <= 10:          ## Creating a loop that print the value of "x", while it is less than or equal to 10
    print(x)
    x = x+1             ## After printing, the value of "x" is increased by 1.
